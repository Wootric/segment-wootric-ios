Wootric integration for analytics-ios.

## Installation

Segment-Wootric is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "Segment-Wootric"
```

## Usage

(It is advised to read [WootricSDK docs](https://github.com/Wootric/WootricSDK-iOS) first.)

First of all you need to provide values for account token, clientID and client secret in Segment's dashboard for Wootric integration, then import Segment-Wootric:

```objective-c
#import <Segment-Wootric/SegmentWootric.h>
```

you can now init the Analytics with Wootric integration:

```objective-c
SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *config = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:@"YOUR_WRITE_KEY"];
WTRWootricIntegrationFactory *wootricFactory = [WTRWootricIntegrationFactory instance];
[config use:wootricFactory];
[SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:config];
```

Wootric integration responds to ```identify``` call, to read more about it, visit [Segment identify method documentation](https://segment.com/docs/libraries/ios/#identify).
In identify call ```traits``` dictionary is set as ```endUserProperties``` in WootricSDK,  except keys ```email``` and ```createdAt``` which are set as ```endUserEmail``` and ```endUserCreatedAt``` respectively.

For custom configuration you can use ```SEGWootric``` class instance, to get it, call:
```objectivec
[WTRWootricIntegration wootric];
```
For all available methods (being instace methods for SEGWootric instead of class methods) please refer to WootricSDK [docs](https://github.com/Wootric/WootricSDK-iOS).
